# Installation

- Add `jekyll_picture_tag` to your Gemfile in the `:jekyll_plugins` group:

  ```ruby
  group :jekyll_plugins do
    gem 'jekyll_picture_tag'
  end
  ```

- Run `$ bundle install`

- See if you have ImageMagick with `$ convert --version`. You should see something like this:

  ```
  ~ $ convert --version
  Version: ImageMagick 7.0.8-14 Q16 x86_64 2018-10-31 https://imagemagick.org
  Copyright: Â© 1999-2018 ImageMagick Studio LLC License: https://imagemagick.org/script/license.php
  Features: Cipher DPC HDRI OpenMP Delegates (built-in): bzlib fontconfig freetype jng jp2 jpeg lcms
  lzma pangocairo png tiff webp xml zlib
  ```

  If you get a 'command not found' error, you'll need to install it. Most package managers know about
  ImageMagick, otherwise it can be found [here](https://imagemagick.org/script/download.php).

- **Note webp under delegates.** This is required if you want to generate webp files. Any image format
  you want to handle will require an appropriate delegate; You may have to install additional packages
  to accomplish this.

## Cropping and Imagemagick

Cropping to an aspect ratio depends on ImageMagick 7+. Ubuntu, somewhat annoyingly, only offers
version 6 in its official repositories. This matters even if you don't run Ubuntu, because many
build & deployment services you might use (including Netlify and Travis CI) do.

If you'd like to use both the cropping feature and such a service, or it's inconvenient to install
version 7 in your development environment, you will likely want to build your site in a docker
container. The Alpine Linux repos include version 7, so you'll want an Alpine Linux based image
rather than an Ubuntu based one. Convenienly this includes the [offical Jekyll
image](https://hub.docker.com/r/jekyll/jekyll).

Once I work out how to actually do that, I'll add some guidance here.
